<!-- need to make a variable that tracks score -->

<!-- Make a timer that counts down on the entire page (lets say 2 min/120sec) -->

<!-- quiz will start when start button is clicked - make an event listener to start quiz/show question and start the timer-->

<!-- each question will have multiple buttons and event listeners to move to next question -->

<!-- if answer is correct add points score tracker and move on to next question, else subtract 5 seconds from timer and move to next question -->

<!-- if all questions are answered or timer reaches 0 game is over => present score, and save initials in local memory to compare to other scores -->
